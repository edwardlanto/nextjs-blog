## What does next do automatically?
Code splitting and prefetching
Next.js does code splitting automatically, so each page only loads whatâ€™s necessary for that page. That means when the homepage is rendered, the code for other pages is not served initially.

## How does the CSS work?
Next.js supports CSS Modules using the [name].module.css file naming convention.


### How does Next use SSR

Static Generation is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at build time. The pre-rendered HTML is then reused on each request.
Server-side Rendering is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on each request.
